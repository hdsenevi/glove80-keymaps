# "SeneviMap" keymap for MoErgo Glove80

This is My MoErgo Glove80 keyboard keymap inspired by parts of ["Glorious Engrammer"](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps) layout.

It's basically a QWERTY layout with Symbol layer lifted from ["Glorious Engrammer"](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps).
